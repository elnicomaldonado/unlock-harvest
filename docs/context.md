# PROJECT CONTEXT: RealFi Cacao Financing Platform

## Problem Statement (Jobs-to-be-Done Framework)

FOR: Smallholder cacao farmers producing high-quality export-grade cacao

WHO: Are trapped in 5-6 month harvest cycles with zero income between harvests, cannot access traditional banking credit due to lack of collateral and formal financial history, and are selling through multi-layered intermediary chains that capture 94% of the final product value (farmers receive only 6% of what a chocolate bar sells for in international markets)

THE PROBLEM IS: Financial exclusion combined with exploitative value chains creates chronic liquidity crises that force economically rational but environmentally devastating decisionsâ€”farmers are actively considering abandoning sustainable cacao cultivation or clearing additional forest land to increase production volume as their only pathways to economic survival

WHICH IMPACTS:
- Economic: Perpetual poverty despite producing premium export goods; inability to invest in farm improvements during multi-month income gaps
- Social: Active crop abandonment and rural migration as farming becomes economically unviable
- Environmental: Direct deforestation risk as farmers clear land to compensate for low per-unit returns

A SUCCESSFUL SOLUTION WOULD: Eliminate the trust barrier through milestone-based smart contract escrows that hold funds securely and release them automatically as farmers hit verified production stages, enable direct pre-purchase agreements where premium buyers guarantee fair prices upfront, and give end consumers cryptographic proof of origin and environmental impact

## Technical Architecture

### Core System (Already Built):
- Milestone-based escrow smart contracts on Celo blockchain
- University oracle (Nest Lab) for verification
- Satellite monitoring integration
- Frontend dashboard for farmers and investors

### NEW FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:
1. **Dynamic NFTs**: NFTs that update their metadata as crop progresses through milestones
2. **Reputation Score**: On-chain credit scoring system for farmers

## Technology Stack:
- Blockchain: Celo (EVM-compatible)
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Framework: Thirdweb SDK
- Frontend: React/Next.js
- Development: Cursor AI Agent Mode

## Key Requirements:
- Must work with existing escrow contract structure
- Oracle updates must be restricted to university address
- All changes must be immutable and timestamped
- Gas-efficient (farmers have limited funds)
- Simple UI for non-technical users
