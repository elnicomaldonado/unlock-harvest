# üèÜ COMPLETE UNLOCK HARVEST MODEL v2.0
**"Purchase Commitments + Reputation Credit + Parametric Insurance"**

## üéØ THE COMPLETE ECOSYSTEM

### Four User Roles:
- **üå± Farmers** - Request funding, build reputation, get insured
- **üè¢ Buyers** (Chocolate companies, cooperatives) - Create purchase commitments  
- **üí∞ Liquidity Providers** (Investors/Community) - Fund escrows, earn returns
- **üîÆ Oracle** - Verify milestones, trigger insurance payouts

## üìä HOW INSURANCE FITS IN (Parametric Model)

### Innovation: Built-in Crop Insurance via Smart Contract
Instead of separate insurance companies, insurance is embedded in the escrow. When a farmer gets financing, a small percentage (5-10%) goes to an insurance pool. If verified climate events destroy crops, instant payout.

### Insurance Mechanics:

**Parametric Triggers (Auto-Payout):**
- Extreme drought (rainfall < 30% normal for 30 days)
- Flooding (rainfall > 200% normal in 7 days)  
- Temperature extremes (>40¬∞C for 14+ consecutive days)
- Pest outbreak (verified by oracle)

**Insurance Pool Structure:**
- Farmer pays 8% of escrow amount as premium (built into financing)
- Buyer/Investor contributes 2% (supply chain protection)
- Total: 10% of escrow goes to insurance pool
- If trigger event occurs: Farmer receives 50-75% of escrow value instantly
- If no trigger: Pool compounds for future claims

**Example:**
```
Farmer receives $1,000 escrow
- $100 goes to insurance pool (10%)
- $900 released via milestones
- If drought verified by oracle: Farmer gets $500 instant payout
- Farmer doesn't lose reputation score (protected claim)
```

## üöÄ COMPLETE USER FLOWS

   - Oracle reviews and approves
   - Receive: $225 (25% of $900)
3. Repeat for milestones 2-4
```

**Insurance Monitoring (Background):**
- Oracle checks weather APIs automatically
- If drought detected (rainfall < 30% of normal):
  - Smart contract triggers checkInsuranceClaim()
  - If conditions met for 30 days:
    - Insurance payout released instantly
    - Farmer receives 75% of remaining escrow
    - Reputation score PROTECTED (not penalized)
    - Buyer refunded their deposit (risk shared)

### Flow 5A: Successful Harvest (Normal Flow)

**Completion:**
```
1. Farmer completes all 4 milestones
2. Delivers 500kg organic cacao to Pacari
3. Oracle verifies:
   - Quantity correct
   - Quality meets standards
   - No deforestation
   - On-time delivery
4. System releases:
   - Final milestone payment to farmer ($225)
   - Buyer's deposit returned ($1,250)
   - Buyer pays farmer for delivery ($1,250)
   - Insurance premium returned to pool (unused)
5. Farmer reputation increases:
   - +50 points (successful harvest)
   - +30 points (premium quality)
   - +50 points (zero deforestation)
   - Total: +130 points ‚Üí moves from Gold to Platinum
```

### Flow 5B: Insured Event (Drought Scenario)

**Insurance Trigger:**
```
1. Week 8: Oracle detects severe drought
   - Rainfall: 15% of normal (trigger: <30%)
   - Duration: 35 consecutive days (trigger: 30 days)
2. Smart contract automatically:
   - Flags harvest as "Climate Event"
   - Checks insurance pool balance
   - Calculates payout: 75% of remaining escrow
   - Example: $675 remaining ‚Üí $500 instant payout
3. Farmer receives:
   - Already released: $225 (Milestone 1)
   - Insurance payout: $500 (protection)
   - Total: $725 of $1,000 escrow (72% protected)
4. Farmer reputation:
   - NO penalty (insured event)
   - +20 points for completing Milestone 1
   - Can apply to new commitments immediately
5. Buyer:
   - Deposit refunded ($1,250)
   - Can create new commitment for replacement
   - Diversified risk (10 farmers, only 1-2 affected)
```

## üí° INSURANCE POOL ECONOMICS

### Sustainability Model:

**Income:**
- 10% of every escrow funded (example: $1,000 escrow = $100 premium)
- If 100 escrows created monthly = $10,000/month income
- Annual pool income: $120,000

**Payouts:**
- Historical climate event frequency: ~10-15% of crops
- Average payout: 60% of escrow value
- Example: 10 claims @ $600 each = $6,000/month
- Annual payouts: $72,000

**Net Pool Growth: $48,000/year**

**Compounding Effect:**
- Year 1: $48K surplus
- Year 2: $96K surplus (pool earns interest)
- Year 3: Pool fully self-sustaining + reserves
- Can reduce premium to 6-7% by Year 3

## üìä TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Smart Contract Changes Needed:

#### Option 1: Extend Existing Contracts (Faster - 2 days)
Add to CacaoEscrow.sol:
```solidity
struct PurchaseCommitment {
    address buyer;
    uint256 quantity; // kg needed
    uint256 pricePerKg;
    uint256 totalValue;
    uint256 deadline;
    string qualityStandards;
    bool insuranceIncluded;
    uint256 buyerDeposit;
    mapping(uint256 => bool) linkedEscrows;
}

mapping(uint256 => PurchaseCommitment) public commitments;
uint256 public commitmentCounter;

function createCommitment(...) external payable { ... }
function applyToCommitment(uint256 commitmentId) external { ... }
function approveApplication(uint256 commitmentId, address farmer) external { ... }
```

Add Insurance Pool Functions:
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public insuranceBalance;
uint256 public totalInsurancePool;

function collectInsurancePremium(uint256 escrowId) internal {
    uint256 premium = (escrowAmount * 10) / 100;
    insuranceBalance[farmer] = premium;
    totalInsurancePool += premium;
}

function claimInsurance(uint256 escrowId, bytes32 weatherProof) external onlyOracle {
    // Verify weather trigger
    // Calculate payout (75% of remaining)
    // Transfer to farmer
    // Update reputation (no penalty)
}
```

#### Option 2: Simple Frontend-Only (Fastest - 1 day)
Since contracts are deployed, simulate commitments in frontend:
- Store commitments in state/localStorage
- Link to existing escrows
- Use your current createEscrow() function
- For hackathon demo: This is perfectly fine!
