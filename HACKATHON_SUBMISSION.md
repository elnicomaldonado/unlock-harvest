# UnlockHarvest - RealFi Hack 2025 Submission

## Problem üå±
70% of cacao farmers in Ecuador are forced to sell future harvests at 
40-60% below market price due to 6-month working capital gap between 
planting and harvest.

**Impact:** 
- Farmers trapped in poverty cycle
- Unable to invest in quality improvements
- No access to fair financing or credit history

## Solution üí°
Oracle-verified milestone escrow contracts that release USDC payments 
throughout the growing season at 4 verified stages:
1. Land Verification
2. Planting Complete
3. Mid-Growth Check
4. Harvest & Delivery

**Key Innovation:**
- Satellite-based verification (no manual inspection needed)
- Portable reputation NFTs (farmers build credit history)
- Parametric climate insurance (protects against weather events)

## Technical Architecture üõ†Ô∏è

**Smart Contracts (Solidity):**
- CacaoEscrow: Milestone-based payment releases
- CommitmentMarketplace: Buyer-farmer matching
- FarmerReputationBadge: On-chain credit scoring
- CacaoHarvestNFT: Traceability and proof of work

**Deployed on Celo Sepolia:**
- All contracts verified on-chain
- Uses Thirdweb SDK v5
- Mobile-first design (Celo's smartphone focus)

## Impact & Scalability üìà

**Immediate Impact:**
- Fair pricing for farmers (market rate, not 40-60% discount)
- Working capital throughout season
- Build credit history for future opportunities

**Scalability:**
- Extend to other crops (coffee, quinoa, bananas)
- Expand to other regions (Latin America, Africa)
- Add more buyers and liquidity providers
- Phase 2: Parametric insurance fully implemented

## Why Celo? üåç
- Mobile-first: Farmers use smartphones, not laptops
- Low fees: Gas costs under $0.01 per transaction
- Stablecoin-native: USDC integration for price stability
- Social impact mission alignment
